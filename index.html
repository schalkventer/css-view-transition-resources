    </h2>

    <p>
      Simply renders a unordered list and reverses the order
      of items each time the button is clicked. Only
      requires a single `view-transition-name` value to be
      set on each `li` element. âœ¨

    <h2>
      <a href="./interactive.html"
        >Alternative Single-page Interactive</a
      >
    </h2>

    <p>
      An example that updates the re-orders the position of
      squares directly on the page with JavaScript. The
      animations are created simply by providing each
      li-element with a unique "view-transition-name" value
      by means of inline CSS.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a href="./option-a.html">Multi-page Navigation</a>
    </h2>

    <p>
      An example that that allows navigation between
      hardcoded HTML pages, the only difference between them
      is that the position of the li-elements (and
      subsequently "view-transition-name") are in different
      places and all pages have a CSS at-rule for
      "@view-transition" that is set to "navigation: auto;".
      There is no JavaScript on any of these pages.
