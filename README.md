# Examples

Note that it is assumed you merely care about the code that was used to create the examples, and that actually testing the examples out are of secondary concern. For this reason, they aren't deployed online. However, you are welcome to clone/download this repository and then follow the steps below, if you want to see them in action.

## Without JavaScript

### "Hello World" ([examples/basic-intro](https://github.com/schalkventer/css-view-transition-resources/tree/main/examples/basic-intro))


<a href="https://github.com/schalkventer/css-view-transition-resources/tree/main/examples/basic-intro">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99555850-ed74-4ef3-9c1d-f6256bf3bc58" width="500">
</a>

You should be able to open either `index.html` or `reversed.html` directly in your browser as a starting point.

### Basic Sorting ([examples/basic-sorting](https://github.com/schalkventer/css-view-transition-resources/tree/main/examples/basic-sorting))

</a>

This example uses an external stylesheet, so it is recommended that you run it through HTTP (and not open the file directly). If you are using VS Code, then you can use [the following extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Alternatively, you should be able to use any server emulation software as well (for example XAMPP, etc.)

### Static Site Generation (SSG) ([examples/filtering-ssg](https://github.com/schalkventer/css-view-transition-resources/tree/main/examples/filtering-ssg))

In addition to using HTTP (as per the above example). The actual HTML files itself is generated by means of running the `build.mjs` file via node: `node build.mjs`. If you are doing Static Site Generation you are probably using [Astro](https://astro.build/), [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) or [one of the following tools](https://jamstack.org/generators/) - the `build.mjs` is just to show the concept with as minimal code as possible.

If you want to test the example above you need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed locally, however the principles/concept should be exactly the same regardless of what tool you are using for SSG.

### Server Side Rendering (SSR) ([examples/filtering-ssr](https://github.com/schalkventer/css-view-transition-resources/tree/main/examples/filtering-ssr))

Similar to the above you need HTTP and Node if you want to run the actual example. However, if you are doing purely server-side rendering you are probably using Express / NestJS / Fastify (Node), Django / Flask (Python), or Laravel / Wordpress (PHP). However, the `server.mjs` file in the example is just to show the concept with as minimal code as possible. You can start the server by running `node server.mjs`.
