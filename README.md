# Examples

Note that it is assumed you merely care about the code that was used to create the examples, and that actually testing the examples out are of secondary concern. For this reason, they aren't deployed online. However, you are welcome to clone/download this repository and then follow the steps below, if you want to see them in action.

## "Hello World" ([examples/basic-intro](https://github.com/schalkventer/css-view-transition-resources/tree/main/examples/basic-intro))

</a>

- You should be able to open either `index.html` or `reversed.html` directly in your browser as a starting point.

## Basic Sorting ([examples/basic-sorting](https://github.com/schalkventer/css-view-transition-resources/tree/main/examples/basic-sorting))

- This example uses an external stylesheet, so it is recommended that you run it through HTTP (and not open the file directly)
- If you are using VS Code, then you can use [the following extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- Alternatively, you should be able to use any server emulation software as well (for example XAMPP, etc.)
