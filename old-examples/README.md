## [Basic Single-page Interactive](https://css-view-transition.vercel.app/interactive-basic.html)

Simply renders a unordered list and reverses the order of items each time the button is clicked. Only requires a single `view-transition-name` value to be set on each `li` element. âœ¨

## [Alternative Single-page Interactive](https://css-view-transition.vercel.app/interative.html)

An example that updates the re-orders the position of squares directly on the page with JavaScript. The animations are created simply by providing each li-element with a unique "view-transition-name" value by means of inline CSS.


## [Multi-page Navigation](https://css-view-transition.vercel.app/option-a.html)

An example that that allows navigation between hardcoded HTML pages, the only difference between them is that the position of the li-elements (and subsequently "view-transition-name") are in different places and all pages have a CSS at-rule for "@view-transition" that is set to "navigation: auto;". There is no JavaScript on any of these pages.
